First goal: handle the "first order fragment" of lojban

Handling quantifiers:
    binding happens where a prenex is or could be, i.e. at 'statement' and at
    'subsentence'.

    This means that an unbound da gets exported to the innermost such prenex,
    and binds just within the corresponding statement/subsentence.

    Handling exportation may be a little complicated... for rather similar
    reasons that handling 'ri' et al will be - the semantics of lojban is
    partly a matter of the partial order of the parse tree, but partly of the
    (cross-level) total order of occurance in the text.

    This actually fits the State Monad approach quite well.

    So when we hit a {da}, we look it up in the state - and if it isn't there,
    add it along with quantifiers and relative clauses. State gets passed
    along vertically and horizontally.
