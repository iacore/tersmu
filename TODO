Support {sei sa'a} and {to'i}?

Rethink questions and illocution. If scope-invariant, does it make sense to
treat questions as modal operators? Handle remaining question words, in any
case (mo, xo, ji, cu'e, fi'a)

use to...toi in lojban for sides?

rename things; try to make JboParse.hs readable.

alternative tags mode, doing away with modals and non-logical sentence
connectives in favour of extra WithEventAs and TagRels?
    Nice idea, but I don't see how to handle complicated joik connected
    tenses; see notes/reductions.

option to render sumti (and tag, abstractor) connectives as quantifiers?

Pretty printing

illocution: ko etc

irrealis UI - allow a free as a selbri tcita, then current free handling
should get the scope right, and we can consider them as modal operators?
