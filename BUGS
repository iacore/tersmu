Bugs, limitations, and questionable design choices
==================================================

All known divergence from baseline (CLL+xorlo), or from plausible
interpretations thereof, is noted here.

Bugs:
    Lojban output of questions is wrong (not a fixed-point; probably just
    needs to use {kau}).

    Question words other than {xu},{ma} and {mo} are not handled properly.

    The parser is only an approximation of camxes, resulting in some bugs:
	free clauses (vocatives, {to} brackets, {sei} etc) sometimes lead to
	    parse errors if they're not at the start of a (sub)sentence;
	{zoi} quotes don't work properly;
	magic words aren't handled accurately, and erasure cmavo not at all.

Limitations:
    Most indicators and frees are ignored, even those such as "irrealis"
    attitudinals which arguably have logical meaning.

    {ko} is not handled specially.

    {ra'o} is ignored.

    The distinction between {lV'e} and {lV} (whatever that might be) is not
    handled.

    We parse the name in "LA sumtiTail", whereas arguably we should just use
    the text. Similarly, we don't keep hold of the raw text of a lu-quote.

    We don't handle {nei} or {no'a}, which have murky and self-referential
    semantics.

    We don't handle {soi}.

    seltcita termsets, as described in CLL 10.25 (e.g. {la frank. sanli zu'a
    nu'i la'u lo mitre be li mu}), are not supported.
    
    We don't handle some donkey sentences which arguably we could, e.g.
	{ro tercange poi ponse lo ke'a xasli cu darxi xy},
    or, more canonically,
	{ro da poi broda ke'a goi xy cu brodi xy}.

Deliberate deviations from baseline, not considered bugs:
    {na broda} is equivalent to {naku broda}; consequently, {ja'a} has no
    logical effect. This is in line with the BPFK section "brivla negators".

    Quantifiers don't scope over (even connected) sentence boundaries, unless
    prenexed.

    We consider {PA da} to introduce a quantifier in the usual logical sense,
    so ignore CLL's rules on rebinding bound variables (CLL:16.14) and
    simultaneous quantification in termsets (CLL:16.7) which conflict with
    this.

    Some constructs are accepted which the official grammar rejects; e.g. the
    tag grammar we use is essentially that of xorxes' zasni gerna.

Other possibly contentious points:
    Sumti put in an already filled place simply replace what was there before;
    this is well-established for GOhA pro-bridi, and we extend it to the
    general case. So e.g. {broda ko'a fe ko'e} == {broda ko'e}.
    Gleki points out some counter-evidence: CLL:9.3.9 and CLL:12.2.3.

    Linkargs on the main selbri are interpreted along with the arguments of
    the main bridi, rather that giving the selbri its own scope; this fits
    with the behaviour of bare tags on selbri, and with CLL:5.12.11.
