Definite bugs:
    ka can't handle multiple ce'u (should return a relation)

Arguable bugs:
    in {broda be da brode ro da}, the first da is in the scope of the second

    seltau are considered to be unary predicates rather than higher arity
    relations. Not clear whether that's correct or not.

    quantifiers on bound variables are ignored. This is contrary to
    CLL:16.14.1-2. But I don't see how to make sense of what's specified
    there.

    According to CLL:16.11.14, bridi negation scopes over the prenex... but I
    don't see how to sensibly extend that to arbitrary statements, so I'm
    ignoring it.

    We have the first part of a guhek being a selbri3 rather than an arbitrary
    selbri. That's because I don't see a sensible way to deal with things like
    {gu'e broda co brode gi brodi ko'a}

    Meanwhile, the BPFK section on brivla negation currently states that {na}
    "has scope over quantifiers that follow". Currently that's how I have
    {na ku} working, but not bare {na}.

    We don't handle donkey anaphora, and so are not in accordance with the
    CLL. For example, we have
	> ro ponse be su'o xasli cu darxi ri
	Prop:FA x1:(EX x2:(xasli(_)). ponse(_,x2)). darxi(x1,x1)
    , which contradicts CLL:7.6.

    Termset quantification: CLL:16.7.5 has quantifiers in the same termset
    having "equal scope", but I don't understand what this means.

Probably not bugs:
    This might seem wrong:
	> na ku mi noi brode cu broda
	Prop:!(brode(mi) /\ broda(mi))
    but consider that e.g.
	> na ku da ro broda be da ku noi brodi cu brodu
	Prop:!EX x1. FA x2:(broda(_,x1)). (brodu(x1,x2) /\ brodi(x2))
    is probably right...

    Also,
	> ro da na ku broda .i je de brode
	Prop:FA x1. !EX x2. (broda(x1) /\ brode(x2))
    is right, because
    	> ro da na ku broda de .i je de brode
	Prop:FA x1. !EX x2. (broda(x1,x2) /\ brode(x2))
    has to be; c.f.
	> ro da na broda de .i je de brode
	Prop:FA x1. EX x2. (!broda(x1,x2) /\ brode(x2)) .
