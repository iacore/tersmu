Bugs, limitations, and questionable design choices
==================================================

All known divergence from baseline (CLL+xorlo), or from plausible
interpretations thereof, is noted here.

FIXME:
    According to 7.6, {ri} counting is done "in order of beginnings" of sumti;
    we're not in accordance with that. Should also review what {ri} can pick
    up - currently only atoms; is that right?

    Think about this:
	09:49 < mensi> zugz: cu'u la'o gy.durka42.gy.: re:tersmus again. {jai
	gau ba'e *ke* broda be fa ko'a} should have a tight binding so that
	broda1=ko'a, iepei? | 2014-12-24T04:54:46.957Z

Bugs:
    Question words other than {xu},{ma} and {mo} are not handled properly.

    The parser is only an approximation of camxes, resulting in some bugs:
	free clauses (vocatives, {to} brackets, {sei} etc) sometimes lead to
	    parse errors if they're not at the start of a (sub)sentence;
	{zoi} quotes don't work properly;
	magic words aren't handled accurately, and erasure cmavo not at all.

Limitations:
    Most indicators and frees are ignored, even those such as "irrealis"
    attitudinals which arguably have logical meaning.

    {ko} is not handled specially.

    {ra'o} is ignored.

    The distinction between {lV'e} and {lV} (whatever that might be) is not
    handled.

    We parse the name in "LA sumtiTail", whereas arguably we should just use
    the text. Similarly, we don't keep hold of the raw text of a lu-quote.

    We don't handle {nei} or {no'a}, which have murky and self-referential
    semantics.

    We don't handle {soi}.

    seltcita termsets, as described in CLL 10.25 (e.g. {la frank. sanli zu'a
    nu'i la'u lo mitre be li mu}), are not supported.

Deliberate deviations from baseline, not considered bugs:
    {na broda} is equivalent to {naku broda}; consequently, {ja'a} has no
    logical effect. This is in line with the BPFK section "brivla negators".

    Quantifiers don't scope over (even connected) sentence boundaries, unless
    prenexed.

    We consider {PA da} to introduce a quantifier in the usual logical sense,
    so ignore CLL's rules on rebinding bound variables (CLL:16.14) and
    simultaneous quantification in termsets (CLL:16.7) which conflict with
    this.

    Some constructs are accepted which the official grammar rejects; e.g. the
    tag grammar we use is essentially that of xorxes' zasni gerna.

Other behaviour whose correctness may not be immediately obvious:
    The {vo'a} series can only refer backwards. To see why, consider
	{vo'e broda ko'a gi'e brode ko'e}.

Other possibly contentious points:
    Sumti put in an already filled place simply replace what was there before.

    Linkarg sumti fill, but do not delete, a place. So e.g.
	{ko'a broda be fa ko'e} == {ko'e broda}
