All known divergence from CLL prescription, or from plausible interpretations
thereof, is noted here.

Definite bugs:
    ka can't handle multiple ce'u (should return a relation)

    {pe bai ko'a} and its ilk aren't implemented properly.

    UI and other indicators are entirely ignored.

    {zoi} works only if the following word is {zoi} (or, arbitrarily, {gy}).

Probably bugs:
    Seltau are considered to be unary predicates rather than higher arity
    relations.

    The way we have {cei broda} working probably isn't as intended; for
    non-compound bridi, we should probably have it binding to the whole bridi
    like {go'i} does.

Possibly bugs:
    Quantifiers on bound variables rebind the variable. This is contrary to
    CLL:16.14.1-2, but I don't see how to make sense of what's specified
    there.

    Termset quantification: CLL:16.7.5 has quantifiers in the same termset
    having "equal scope", but I don't understand what this means.

Other deviations from CLL, not considered bugs, but which maybe ought to be
optional:
    {na broda} is equivalent to {naku broda}.

    Consequently, {ja'a} has no effect.

    Quantifiers don't scope over (even connected) sentence boundaries.

    Some constructs are accepted which the official grammar rejects; e.g. the
    tag grammar we use is essentially that of xorxes' zasni gerna.
