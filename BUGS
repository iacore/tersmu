All known divergence from CLL prescription, or from plausible interpretations
thereof, is noted here.

Definite bugs:
    ka can't handle multiple ce'u (should return a relation)

    Only the simplest {goi} phrases, those of the form {[sumti] goi ko'a}, are
    currently handled.

    {ri} doesn't ignore anaphoric pro-sumti.

Probably bugs:
    Current gadri (non)-handling is probably inconsistent with xorlo.

    We have the first part of a guhek being a selbri3 rather than an arbitrary
    selbri. That's because I don't see a sensible way to deal with things like
    {gu'e broda co brode gi brodi ko'a}

    Seltau are considered to be unary predicates rather than higher arity
    relations.

    Only sumti are allowed in GOI phrases, not arbitrary terms. That's mostly
    sensible - but means we don't allow {pe BAI ko'a}, which is actually used.

    The way we have {cei broda} working probably isn't as intended; for
    non-compound bridi, we should probably have it binding to the whole bridi
    like {go'i} does.

Possibly bugs:
    Quantifiers on bound variables are ignored. This is contrary to
    CLL:16.14.1-2. But I don't see how to make sense of what's specified
    there. (xorxes suggests that {PA da} when {da} is already bound should be
    treated as introducing a new quantifier, with subsequent {da} in its
    scope.)

    Termset quantification: CLL:16.7.5 has quantifiers in the same termset
    having "equal scope", but I don't understand what this means.

    We treat {broda zo'e goi ko'a ko'a} as equivalent to {broda zo'e zo'e}.

Other deviations from CLL, not considered bugs, but which maybe ought to be
optional:
    {na broda} is equivalent to {naku broda}.

    Quantifiers don't scope over (even connected) sentence boundaries.

    Logical tanru connectives are treated like other logical connectives.
    (This seems to contradict only the letter of CLL, and is consistent with
    its examples.)

    We use the tag grammar from xorxes' zasni gerna, which allows some tag
    constructions which the official parser considers ungrammatical.
