All known divergence from CLL prescription, or from plausible interpretations
thereof, is noted here.

Definite bugs:
    UI and other indicators are entirely ignored.

    {zoi} works only if the following word is {zoi} (or, arbitrarily, {gy}).

Probably bugs:
    Seltau are considered to be unary predicates rather than higher arity
    relations.

    {cei} only works as '=:'

Possibly bugs:
    Quantifiers on bound variables rebind the variable. This is contrary to
    CLL:16.14.1-2, but I don't see how to make sense of what's specified
    there.

    Termset quantification: CLL:16.7.5 has quantifiers in the same termset
    having "equal scope", but I don't understand what this means.

    We don't handle {nei} or {no'a}, which have murky and self-referential
    semantics.

    We don't handle {soi}.

Other deviations from baseline, not considered bugs:
    {na broda} is equivalent to {naku broda}; consequently, {ja'a} has no
    logical effect. This is in line with the BPFK section "brivla negators".

    Quantifiers don't scope over (even connected) sentence boundaries.

    Some constructs are accepted which the official grammar rejects; e.g. the
    tag grammar we use is essentially that of xorxes' zasni gerna.

Other behaviour whose correctness may not be immediately obvious:
    The {vo'a} series can only refer backwards. To see why, consider
	{vo'e broda ko'a gi'e brode ko'e}.
