All known divergence from baseline (CLL+xorlo), or from plausible
interpretations thereof, is noted here.

Definite bugs:
    {zoi} works only if the following word is {zoi} (or, arbitrarily, {gy}).

    Occasional misparsings with MAI, e.g. on {za'u re'u re mai broda}.

    {bu'a} quantification isn't handled.

    {ra'o} is ignored.

    No serious effort has been made to handle magic word interactions
    correctly.

Probably bugs:
    {cei} only works as '=:'

    {ka} doesn't interpret multiple {ce'u} as giving an n-ary relation, as
    mandated by CLL:11.4.

    We parse the name in "LA sumtiTail", whereas arguably we should just use
    the text.

    We don't handle {nei} or {no'a}, which have murky and self-referential
    semantics.

    We don't handle {soi}.

Possibly bugs:
    Quantifiers on bound variables rebind the variable. This is contrary to
    CLL:16.14.1-2, but I don't see how to make sense of what's specified
    there.

    Termset quantification: CLL:16.7.5 has quantifiers in the same termset
    having "equal scope", but I don't see what this could mean.

Other deviations from baseline, not considered bugs:
    {na broda} is equivalent to {naku broda}; consequently, {ja'a} has no
    logical effect. This is in line with the BPFK section "brivla negators".

    Quantifiers don't scope over (even connected) sentence boundaries.

    Some constructs are accepted which the official grammar rejects; e.g. the
    tag grammar we use is essentially that of xorxes' zasni gerna.

Other behaviour whose correctness may not be immediately obvious:
    The {vo'a} series can only refer backwards. To see why, consider
	{vo'e broda ko'a gi'e brode ko'e}.
