tersmu-0.2.2
============

tersmu is a semantic parser for the engineered human language Lojban
(www.lojban.org). It translates lojban text to a predicate logic.

Please note that this is an entirely unofficial project. Although the aim to
follow baseline prescription where feasible, the semantics this program
attributes to lojban text may in some cases be non-standard and/or wrong.

See the examples/ directory for some examples, BUGS for limitations, docs/ for
other documentation.


Installation
------------
tersmu is in hackage, so you can install it using cabal.

Install cabal if necessary, e.g. on debian-based systems:
    apt-get install cabal-install

Then install tersmu:
    cabal update && cabal install tersmu

This will install the binary to ~/.cabal/bin/tersmu by default; you may wish 
to add the cabal bin directory to your path in your .bashrc or .zshrc:
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.cabal/bin

To install a modified version, edit the source in this directory then run:
    make install

Docker Installation
-------------------
If you use docker, you can build and run a docker image with tersmu installed by running
    docker build -t tersmu .
    docker run -it tersmu

once inside the container, you can run tersmu with
    tersmu

Hacking
-------
Lojban.hs and Morphology.hs are generated from the corresponding .pappy files,
using a bugfixed version of Bryan Ford's Pappy. Please see the Makefile for
details on that.

docs/overview is intended as a guide to the general architecture of the code.
