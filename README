tersmu-0.1rc1
=============

tersmu is a semantic parser for the engineered human language Lojban
(www.lojban.org). It translates lojban text to a predicate logic.

Please note that this is an entirely unofficial project. Although the aim to
follow baseline prescription where feasible, the semantics this program
attributes to lojban text may in some cases be non-standard and/or wrong.

See the examples/ directory for some examples, and doc/ for documentation.
