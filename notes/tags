Tenses and modals
=================

Tense tags should clearly scope like quantifiers and negation; 

For BAI, there are two reasonable possibilities:
    (i) behaving identically to tenses
	(except for the weird difference with connectives)
    (ii) behaving like positional arguments to a bridi

(ii) is what CLL seems to suggest.

(i) allows greater expressivity, e.g.
    ni'i ko'a na broda
    na broda .i se ri'a bo brode
    pu gau mi ba broda

I suspect what's really going on is that BAI conflates two grammatical
functions; we have properly modal operators, like ni'i and bai, which are
propositions about the event/proposition; indeed, the corresponding gismu
(often) have places for the event to go in. But we also have BAI like be'i
and ka'a, which really do seem to fill the advertised role of adding a missing
place to a selbri.

e.g. what could
    ve ka'a ko'a na bajra
mean, if not 
    na ku ve ka'a ko'a bajra ?

For current purposes, I think we should simply go for (i), being the most
general option; if the semantics of some BAI end up meaning they commute with
other operators, that's not our current business.

The semantics of tense is, in contrast, mostly quite clear, to the extent that
we could hope to expand into predications about events; but that's still best
done as interpretation of the modal logic.


ki
--
ki as a sumtcita is unproblematic.

But e.g. what does
    na ku pu ki broda .i brode
mean? Blatant donkey?

If tenses are quantifiers, then ki makes no sense?

But some tenses certainly are quantifiers - e.g. {roroi}.

Maybe {ki} should apply to *all* bridi operators - negation and quantification
included? And really function as an afterthought {zo'u tu'e}? Pretty drastic.

One alternative is the purely syntactic one - 
    na ku pu ki broda .i brode
simply means
    na ku pu broda .i pu brode

Is that really the best we can do?

Well... we could give up on the interaction with negation etc, and effectively
go for option (ii) above for tenses too (with order of tenses still mattering,
natch). Then {ki} would just repeat the operator on all future bridi.

I think giving up on {ki} would be preferable (it can always be replaced with
{ca ko'a zo'u tu'e}, after all).

Cunning alternative: have {ki} with a tense be equivalent to {ca zo'e ki} (if
that parses right) - i.e. it fixes a constant time, and sets the base time to
that. Makes much sense! Similarly with other tags.


Connectives
-----------
For these, we seem forced to add an operator which assigns a variable to an
event of a proposition. See notes/tenseConnections for details.

(It should be a variable rather than a constant so we can handle things like
    ro danlu cu jbena gi'e ba bo morsi
->
    Ax:danlu(_). Ey. (y=. jbena(x) /\ (ba)(y). morsi(x))
)

Tense grammar
-------------
I agree with xorxes that the current complicated grammar of tenses is not
reflected in the semantics. So we can reasonably use the zasni gerna tense
grammar (which only adds productions, and requires no extra semantics, except
for newly legal {SE [tense]}).

Implementation
--------------
Add modal operators to the logic:
    data Prop r t o = ... | Operator o Prop
and their lojban instances:
    data JboOperator
	= Tagged Tag (Maybe JboTerm)
	| WithEventAs JboTerm
    data Tag
	= Tag {tagNAI::Bool, tagBase::TagBase}
	| TagJOI Cmavo Tag Tag
	| TagNAhE Cmavo Tag
    data tagBase
	= TenseCmavo Cmavo
	| FAhA Bool Cmavo
	| ROI {roiIsSpace::Bool, roiQuantifier::Quantifier}
	| TAhE_ZAhO {taheZoheIsSpace::Bool, taheZahoCmavo::Cmavo}
	| BAI Cmavo
	| FIhO JboPred
