Trying to make sense of CLL prescription:
    I can't.

Since we've already dropped CLL's magic selbri NA and selbri tags, things are
neater than they might be; in particular we can ignore the "replacement"
semantics of 15.8-9.

Giheks: if GOhA can bind to a compound bridi, need to decide how a compound
bridi can act as a tertau...

Clue?:
    cei can't get at a compound bridi. So maybe go'i shouldn't either?

    But cei does bind terms, which can be connected or quantified, which isn't
    really different from getting a compound bridi.

Simplest semantics:
    GOhA binds to a JboRel with some Args.
    But then any negations and tags are lost, and quantified terms give
    donkeys.

Most complicated semantics:
    GOhA binds to a Bridi = Args -> JboProp
    and we somehow (?) make sense of this acting as tertau

Rethinking tanru:
    Tanru as bridi operators, analogous to other modal operators?

    Note that xorxes' zasni gerna does allow tertau to be tagged.

    So we could have parseTU :: BridiM Bridi, which would be a relief.

    Hmm... but we don't actually want a difference between
	ro da broda brode
    and
	broda brode fa ro da
    , so they can't act wholly analogously to tags...

    (
	{do xamgu na cladu}?
	{do na(ku) cladu .i xamgu go'i}?
	{do xamgu cladu be naku}?
	{do xamgu cladu naku}?

	No, we can't do that.
    )

    So as operators, they commute with all other operators.

    So in fact, this is equivalent to simply having a seltau act on a
    JboProp by acting on all JboRels in it.

    So let's do that.
