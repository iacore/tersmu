{gi'a ba bo} etc

By 10.17.10 and common sense, the tag takes effect only in the case that both
connectunds hold.

One solution is to put tagged connectives into our logic as connective
annotations. But putting BAI in is surely a bad idea.

So perhaps we should take a more direct approach: render it as a disjunct over
the possible boolean combinations, with tags ignored except in the TT case,
when we handle them as we would without logical part.

So we reduce to handling
    {.i bai ja ba bo}
and its ilk.

For these:
    for BAI: add to the left a tag with an event variable for the right;
    for tense: add a tense operator to the right with an event variable for
	the left.

Actually, there's a better solution than the "TT-skimming" approach above,
which is the one that's now implemented:
> broda i ja ba bo brode
EX x1. (x1=. broda( ) \/ (ba)(x1). brode( ))

this works as desired: since EX x1. (ba)(x1). brode() is just equivalent to
brode(), there's only a tense condition in the case that both disjuncts hold.
