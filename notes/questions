Definitely a challenge!

Recall:
    question words in subclauses affect the top-level statement;
    {kau} can appear anywhere, and corresponds to a question as to the
    indentity of the preceding construct (which need not be a question word);
    {xu kau} is further magic, and doesn't rise to the top like bare {xu};

{kau} in particular is going to be a nightmare, and should perhaps be taken as
evidence that we need to handle indicators much more subtly than I'd been
hoping to get away with.

But for now we can take the easy way out, and pretend there's a selma'o KAU
which is allowed only in those positions required to allow the q-kaus.

The semantics of questions are clear. Representing connective questions will
be a pain, though - we effectively want a notation for quantifying over
propositional and sumti connectives (noting that there's only one question in
{ko'a .e ko'e broda je'i brode}).

For indirect questions: it's simply a matter of scope.
(We might as well support subscripted kau to allow getting at higher embedded
scope, as with ce'u/ke'a.)

Another thing to consider: what does it mean to answer
    {re da ma broda}
with {ro de}, or indeed {da}? No answer in prescription. I'm currently
thinking it's best to consider question quantifiers to have maximal scope,
effectively, and parallel GOhA, so e.g. answering with {da} means claiming
{de zo'u re da de broda}.

Connective questions then should scope-jump analogously:
    {re da ko'a ji ko'e broda}
==
    {de po'u ko'a ji ko'e zo'u re da de broda}
(or, just as well,
    {ko'a ji ko'e vu'o goi fo'a zo'u re da fo'a broda})
~~
    "for which of ko'a and ko'e do two things broda it?"
although we have to have
    {mi .a do ge'i broda gi brode}
==
    {da po'u no ji pa zo'u
	ga ge ganai da du no gi mi broda
	   gi ganai da du pa gi mi brode
	gi ge ganai da du no gi do broda
	   gi ganai da du pa gi do brode}
==
    {li xy po'u li pa ji li re zo'u
	ga se xi xy mi broda gi mi brode
	gi se xi xy do broda gi do brode}
Ah, but these logical tricks are no good, since we want to allow non-logical
connectives as answers...
How about
    {ge li jy du li pa ji li re ge
	ga ju'e xi jy mi broda gi mi brode
	gi ju'e xi jy do broda gi do brode},
where we just declare that this works for both logical and non-logical?

So on the semantic side, we need:
    new quantifier ("for what x", "?x1." / {da po'u ma});
    another quantifier "?x1:(ko'a,ko'e).", corresponding to
	{da po'u ko'a ji ko'e};
    yet another quantifier "?<c1>." and a new connective <c1>
	(and yes, we really do want multiple variable types)
    new bridi quantifier for {mo}.
