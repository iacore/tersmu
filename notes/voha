Should be able to refer to as-yet-unspecified sumti, which causes problems
with e.g.
    vo'e broda ko'a gi'e brode ko'e
or
    lo brodi be vo'e broda ko'a gi'e brode ko'e

Actually, not too bad: we just need an extra JboTerm constructor,
MainBridiSumti Int, and every time we add a positional argument to a main
bridi we do a mapProp which does a substitution. That will fork appropriately
in the above examples. Most annoying bit then is just having to know when
we're in a "main bridi".
