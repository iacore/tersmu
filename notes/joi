From the discussion in CLL, it seems we can consider JOI to have precisely two
functions:
(i) as propositional connectives, entirely analogous to the logical ones but
    with murkier semantics acting on the events/predications
	(e.g. it refers to {joi gi broda gi brode .iseri'abo brodi} as meaning
	that broda and brode combined cause brodi)
(ii) tanru connections
(iii) sumti connections

All joi productions, including term connections, except tanru and sumti
connections, should be expanded to (i) analogously with logical connections.

It would be nice to reduce (ii) to (i), e.g. to say that the tanru-unit {broda
joi brode} refers to the (say unary) relation {joi gi ce'u broda gi ce'u
brode}. But 5.6.20 suggests otherwise.

We can however try to reduce (i) to (iii). We can interpret
{joi gi broda gi brode .iseri'abo brodi} as implying
{lo nu broda ku joi lo nu brode cu rinka lo nu brodi}.

Tags are binary relations;
    (ba)(x). broda()
is shorthand for
    EX e. (e=. broda() /\ (ba)(x,e))
where in fact (ba)(x,e) == selbalvi(x,e)
(but bare tenses still obey special rules, which we shouldn't try to
implement, as to what should go in for x)

However, I think we should go with adding non-logical connectives to the
logic, and merely having it as the intended semantics that
    EX e. EX e1. EX e2.
	(e=. (e1=. broda() {joi} e2=. brode())
	/\ e=(e1{joi}e2))
