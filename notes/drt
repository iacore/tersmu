What relevance Discourse Representation Theory?

On a meta-level: our parse-tree-breaking incrementative monadic parsing has a
similar feel to the parse-breaking incrementative nature of DRT.

We can think of xorlo as giving discourse referents, but that doesn't seem to
be very deep.

I don't think we can expect any analogue of DRT's handling of negation or
conditionals or donkeys; montagovian semantics is too deeply embedded in
lojban. So I expect it's mostly useless to us.

DRT may help to explain malrarbau usage of lojban, though.
